    <h1>Hello!</h1>
    <h2>I'm Ashley Chen </h2>
    <h3>I'm a Product Manager at Vimeo, and I'm taking this class so that I can earn my engineers' respect</h3>
    <p>Kidding! I've been adjacent to coding since I went to Carnegie Mellon University - all students are requiered to take a computer science course before they graduate. 
        I barely passed that course, and have ahd a chip (ha!) on my shoulder ever since. This front end web development course is not only something that will help me in my career, but will also prove to myself that I actually do know what I'm doing!
